Revision history for Perl extension Statistics::R.

0.20  2011-08-31
    - Refactored the entire R communication bridge to avoid writing and reading
      files. All data is now stored in memory and passed by pipes. This fixes
      bug RT #11309, #11918, #66190 and #70314
    - Refactored the communications in shared mode
    - Put platform-specific code and legacy code in separate modules

0.10  2011-08-27  
    - Refactoring to remove old code doing platform-specific operations.
    - Lots of code cleanup
    - Removed the now useless r_dir and tmp_dir options of new()
    - Fix for change of dir bug (RT #6724). Also fixes missing synopsis file (RT #70307)
    - More subtle cleanup procedure (RT #70392)

0.09  2011-08-23 
    - Changes in the new() method:
       * it automatically calls start()
       * it has the 'shared' option to start a shared bridge
    - More portable filenames (RT #70391)
    - Added convenience methods:
       * run() replaces send() and read() and checks for errors (RT #70361)
       * get() fetches the values in an R vector (RT #70361)
       * set() assigns values to an R vector
    - Fixed a bug in the unlock() method
    - Removed the R() and error() methods and renamed some other. These changes
      should be transparent and backward compatible
    - Maintenance: many more unit tests, synopsis clarification, POD work, script
      touchups, small code cleanups, version numbering, better README generation,
      Git and bug tracker URLs

0.08  2011-03-01
    - Pass options in new() to Statistics::R::Bridge constructor (RT #63906)

0.07  2010-11-08

    - Fix "uninitialized value" warning in read_processR() (RT #61414)

0.05  2010-09-13
    - Major code refactor:
      - strict + warnings wherever possible
      - Removed some layers of abstraction
      - Win32/Linux classes are now simple subs
      - Basic syntax tidying
      - POD fix, plus pod test

0.04  2010-08-28
    - Basic code cleanup with the intention of doing major refactoring by-and-by
    - Fix the test suite

    - Fixed RT Bug #23948: bug in Statistics::R 
    - Fixed --gui
      - RT Bug #17925: R --slave --vanilla --gui=none is now R --slave --vanilla --gui=X11
      - RT Bug #20515: Fwd: Delivery Status Notification (Failure)
      - RT Bug #14324: error message with recent versions of R
      We used the patch from barry.moore since it correctly identifies that we probably 
      don't want the GUI.  
    - Fixed RT Bug #17956: Win32: log_dir is not in tmp_dir by default as advertised
