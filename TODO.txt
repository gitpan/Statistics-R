Done:
have synopsis and tests work in windows
replaced select undef, undef, undef, 0.1 by sleep(0.1)
removed useless r_dir and tmp_dir options
using File::Spec to obtain temp dir instead of platform-dependent crap code
location of R detected by File::Which instead of plarform-dependent crap code
chdir fix (RT bug #6724). Also fixes missing file in synopsis (RT #70307)
read_file(), write_file(), touch_file()
more subtle cleanup procedure (Bug #70392)



TODO:


* use module::install and require R so that tests cannot be started without a
  proper R installation

* Fix dev.null error

* Add myself as author, e.g. Florent Angly (2011 interface cleanup, convenience functions, initialization refactoring, bug fixes)






* Test r_bin option of new()
* I die if R not found, but I still get unrelated warnings?
* filehandles to write to scalars instead of files...
* maybe not possible, but is it possible for R to read from stdin instead of source'ing a file?
* chmod and chmod_all are ugly!
* silence "used only once" warnings due to my function aliases
* FAIL: keep track of last file written instead of scanning dir everytime...
* FAIL: also remove log_dir if it had to be created, i.e. did not exist before
* NO NEED, SEEMS TO WORK: may have to alias glob: on win, call win32_glob that requires dosglob and does string escapes
